# Grid_Tie_Inverter
An attempt to make my own GTI with acceptable output harmonics.
<br><br>
This is a work in progress. This is our setup: <br>
 - An STM32F407<br>
 - A DRV8301 Boost board for it's H-Bridge<br>
 - An LC output filter<br>
<br>
<br>
Currently working on a control system to output a sinusoidal current.
